# Back End E-Commerce Site

## Motivation
I created this app to familiarize myself with sequelize.

## Problem-Solving
This app will help keep track of inventory for shop owners.

## Knowledge Gained
Creating this app helped me better acquaint myself with back-end procedures such as testing, creating and updating databases, and .gitignore files.
